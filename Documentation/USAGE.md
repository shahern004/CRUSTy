## Advanced Features

### Recipient-Specific Encryption

CRUSTy allows you to encrypt files specifically for a recipient using their email address:

1. In the main screen, check the "Use recipient-specific encryption" box
2. Enter the recipient's email address
3. Select or create a master encryption key
4. Proceed with encryption as normal

When a file is encrypted for a specific recipient:

- The recipient's email is used to derive a unique encryption key
- The file can only be decrypted using both the master key and knowledge of the recipient's email
- The recipient information is stored within the encrypted file

To decrypt a recipient-specific file:

1. Load the master key that was used for encryption
2. CRUSTy will automatically detect if the file was encrypted for a specific recipient
3. The recipient's email will be displayed in the results after successful decryption

### Embedded System Integration

CRUSTy supports offloading cryptographic operations to an STM32H5 embedded device for enhanced performance and security:

1. Connect your STM32H573I-DK or compatible device to your computer
2. In the main screen, check the "Use embedded system for cryptographic operations" box
3. Select the appropriate connection type (USB, Serial, or Ethernet)
4. Enter the device ID or address
5. Add any required connection parameters in the "Advanced Connection Parameters" section
6. Click "Apply Configuration"

Once configured, all encryption and decryption operations will be performed on the embedded device instead of your computer.

#### Connection Types

- **USB**: Use for direct connection to the STM32H5 device. Enter the device ID (e.g., `VID:PID` format).
- **Serial/UART**: Use for serial connection. Enter the port name (e.g., `COM3` on Windows, `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux).
- **Ethernet**: Use for network connection. Enter the IP address and port (e.g., `192.168.1.100:8080`).

#### Advanced Parameters

Depending on your connection type, you may need to specify additional parameters:

- For Serial: `baud_rate`, `data_bits`, `parity`, `stop_bits`
- For USB: `interface`, `endpoint`
- For Ethernet: `timeout`, `keep_alive`

#### Benefits

- **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated encryption is faster for large files
- **Security**: Cryptographic operations are isolated from the main system
- **Power Efficiency**: Reduces CPU load on your computer

### Batch Processing

For encrypting or decrypting multiple files at once:

1. Select "Multiple Files" mode
2. Click "Select Files" to choose multiple files
3. Select an output directory
4. Select or create an encryption key
5. Click "Encrypt" or "Decrypt"

Progress for each file will be displayed during the operation.

## Split Key Functionality

CRUSTy supports splitting encryption keys into multiple shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing, enhancing security through multi-party authorization:

1. **Creating Split Keys**:

   - In the key management section, select a key to split
   - Choose the threshold (minimum shares needed for reconstruction)
   - Choose the total number of shares to create
   - Click "Split Key"

2. **Storing Shares**:

   - The primary share is automatically stored in your system's secure credential store
   - Save the secondary share to a file on a different device or storage medium
   - Create a recovery share as a mnemonic phrase or QR code for emergency backup

3. **Reconstructing Keys**:
   - To reconstruct a key, you need at least the threshold number of shares
   - The primary share is retrieved from the credential store
   - Load the secondary share from its file
   - If needed, input the recovery share from the mnemonic phrase or QR code
   - The key is reconstructed only if the correct shares are provided

This approach enhances security by ensuring that no single point of compromise can expose the encryption key.

## Troubleshooting

**Troubleshooting Decision Tree**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Error Encountered] --> B{Error Type}
    B -->|Authentication Failed| C[Check Key]
    B -->|Destination Exists| D[Change Output Path]
    B -->|Embedded Backend| E[Check Device Connection]
    C -->|Wrong Key| F[Try Different Key]
    C -->|Correct Key| G[Check File Integrity]
    E -->|Not Connected| H[Verify Device ID]
    E -->|Connected| I[Check Device Power]
    H --> J[Try Different Connection Type]
    I --> K[Reduce File Size]
```

### Common Issues

**Error: "Destination file already exists"**

- CRUSTy will not overwrite existing files for safety
- Delete the existing file or choose a different output directory

**Error: "Authentication failed: The encryption key is incorrect or the file is corrupted"**

- Make sure you're using the same key that was used to encrypt the file
- If using recipient-specific encryption, ensure the correct master key is loaded

**Error: "Failed to decrypt: Wrong encryption key used"**

- Try a different encryption key
- If you've lost the key, the file cannot be recovered

**Error: "Embedded backend not implemented"**

- This error occurs when trying to use the embedded backend before it's properly configured
- Make sure you've clicked "Apply Configuration" after entering the device details
- Check that your device is properly connected and powered on

**Error: "Failed to connect to embedded device"**

- Verify that the device ID/address is correct
- Check physical connections (USB cable, network connection, etc.)
- Ensure the device is powered on and running the CRUSTy firmware
- Try a different connection type if available

**Error: "Communication error with embedded device"**

- The connection was established but was interrupted during operation
- Check for loose connections
- Ensure the device has stable power
- Try reducing the file size if the operation involves large files
